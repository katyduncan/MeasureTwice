# Measure Twice
DBC Final Project

This app aims to provide a user-friendly tool for simulating furniture arrangement within a given space to take the guesswork out of moving.

We utilized the SVG.js library to construct the images in real-time with our furniture arrangement tool. Some pieces were missing from the library, slowing down progress. We built our own custom rotation method to accommodate that feature, for example.

Current development state:
* User can log in using Facebook OmniAuth
* User can input room dimensions
* User can add predrawn furniture with custom dimensions to draw tool
* User can drag furniture on draw tool
* User can rotate furniture on draw tool
* User can add image url for a custum piece of furniture
* User can save current room layout

Work still in progress. Checkout the development branch for latest version.
